GeoJSONs for uMap *Archionkarte 2.0*

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
The genealogy platform [ARCHION](https://www.archion.de) provides access to digitised church records. To gain a better overview of the locations of the 175,000 church books that have already been digitised, a uMap has been set up:
* [Archionkarte 2.0. Read-only](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/de/map/archionkarte-20_113993)

This GitHub repository helps to maintain the underlying GeoJSONs so that they correctly reflect the digitisation status on the map.

<!-- CONTRIBUTION -->
## Contribution
As soon as new church records are uploaded to [ARCHION](https://www.archion.de/de/archion-entdecken/alle-news/neue-digitalisate), all help is welcome. Just dial into public biweekly [WikiTree Stammtisch Zoom](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Stammtisch) and you will be made a collaborator of the GitHub repository.

Ongoing projects can be found on web page of [WikiTree Stammtisch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Stammtisch). Please announce your project either in biweekly [WikiTree Stammtisch](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Stammtisch) or on the *Work in Progress* list on the web page under chapter 4 *Archionkarte 2.0*.

There are no requirements set for pushes to *main* at the moment for project collaborators.

<!-- Change Log -->
## Change Log
Changes shall be documented in CHANGELOG.


<!-- Archive -->
## Archive
GeoJSONs under folder *geojson* should not be uploaded to uMap. Those are archived versions which were published by user **Basil** in January 2025 on legacy uMap [Archionkarte](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/de/map/archionkarte_46875).
