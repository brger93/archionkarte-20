Maintaining geojsons for uMap Archionkarte 2.0

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The geneology platform ARCHION provides access to digitalised church books. To have a better overview of the location of the already digitalised 175,000 church books, a uMap was set-up: Archionkarte 2.0.

This repo helps maintaining the underlying json files to correctly reflect the digitalisation status on the map.
