Maintaining geojsons for uMap Archionkarte 2.0

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The genealogy platform ARCHION provides access to digitised church records. To gain a better overview of the locations of the 175,000 church books that have already been digitised, a uMap has been set up: [Archionkarte 2.0.](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/de/map/archionkarte-20_113993#6/51.000/15.084)

This repository helps to maintain the underlying JSON files so that they correctly reflect the digitisation status on the map.
