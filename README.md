Maintaining GeoJSONs for uMap Archionkarte 2.0

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The genealogy platform ARCHION provides access to digitised church records. To gain a better overview of the locations of the 175,000 church books that have already been digitised, a uMap has been set up: [Archionkarte 2.0.](https://umap.openstreetmap.de/de/map/archionkarte-20_113993#6/51.000/15.084)

This repository helps to maintain the underlying GeoJSONs so that they correctly reflect the digitisation status on the map.

<!-- CONTRIBUTION -->
## Contribution
All help is welcome. As soon as new church records are uploaded to [ARCHION](https://www.archion.de/de/archion-entdecken/alle-news/neue-digitalisate), anyone can create a PR for the existing GeoJSONs.
